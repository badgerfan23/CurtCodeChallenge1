1) the html file PrimeNumberClients.html contains the code for the client side to consume to the .Net restful web service.
For consuming the web service, there's no parameter needed in the ajax call.

2)  The folder PrimeNumberService contains the wcf code on the server side for computing the first 1000 prime numbers.

3) The image file "ClientSideConsumingPrimeNumberWebService.JPG" contains a screenshot of the client side 
consuming the .Net Web Service.

4) I include two small test cases on the client side using Qunit to check the Ajax call.
